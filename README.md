# Add your liked songs to a new playlist

Since Spotify doesn't allow you to copy your liked songs into  
a new playlist I have made this script that allows you to do so.

## Usage Instructions:

1. Install spotipy

```bash
pip install spotipy
```

2. [Create a Spotify application](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard)

3. Inside the main.py file, replace os.environ["CLIENT_ID"]  
   AND os.environ["CLIENT_SECRET"] with your spotify credentials.

4. Rename your playlist (optional) in the main.py file (commented)
